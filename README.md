## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome To My GitHub Profile 
### I'm Matheus Ribeiro, AKA The Sirion. 

#### This is what you need to know about me:
- You can probably tell, but I love to code. But in a project, if I have to choose an **END** to be on, I'll probably go to the **FRONT**;
- Nowadays I code almost exclusively in **JavaScript**, but I also know **Python** and **Java**;
- I also have dabbled with a few other languages and frameworks, like **Dart** for Flutter, or **Spring**, for instance;
- My JavaScript framework of choice is **React**, but unless I'm doing a big and complex project, what I prefer to use only **vanilla JavaScript**;
- I'm an insatiable consumer of APIs. I just love them. Yum yum!
- Some would call me a madman, but I actually like CSS. It's amazing the crazy stuff that can be done without a single line of JS. Mastering CSS is an art and every front-end developer should strive to achieve it!
- Right now I'm working on improving my React and SQL skills. Soon I intend to delve deeper on Node. I also want to learn **TypeScript** and **MongoDB**. They look so sexy!
- Before learning to code, I used to be a translator, and I know **Brazilian Portuguese** natively (vai um aÃ§aÃ­?), **English** fluently (otherwise I wouldn't be writing this), and **German** decently (ich trinke doch kein Bier);
- This means I'm also a pretty decent writer. Need someone to write your docs?
#### What did you do in 2020? I mean, besides staying at home and stuff.
I created a study group server on Discord where we help each other in our studies and colaborate in projects. We had a web forum project that was meant to cement what we're learning but unfortunately it was discontinued for simple lack of engagement. Meanwhile, I built a Habbo Hotel fan site for a client using Bootstrap, but since it never went online, I'm not allowed to show it.
#### So what are you working on right now?
Like I said, I'm working on improving my React and SQL skills, but while I still don't have much to show in my GitHub account of my progress (please bear with me, it's coming!), what I *do* have is a few vanilla JS projects I made not long ago that are very simple, but also clever and I'm really proud of. With each one of them I tried to explore a different aspect of what I can do with JavaScript, like infinite scrolling, for instance. I also tried to make games with Canvas, but I gotta admit. I kind of hated the Canvas API. But who knows in the future?
