## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome To My GitHub Profile 
### I'm Matheus Ribeiro, AKA The Sirion. 

This is what you need to know about me:

- You can probably tell, but I love to code. But in a project, if I have to choose an **END** to be on, I'll probably go to the **FRONT**;
- Nowadays I code almost exclusively in **JavaScript**, but I also know **Python** and **Java**;
- I also have dabbled with a few other languages and frameworks, like **Dart** for Flutter, or **Spring**, for instance;
- My JavaScript framework of choice is **React**, but unless I'm doing a big and complex project, what I prefer to use only **vanilla JavaScript**;
- I'm an insatiable consumer of APIs;
- Right now I'm working on improving my React and SQL skills. Soon I intend to delve deeper on Node. I also want to learn TypeScript and MongoDB.They look so sexy!
- Before learning to code, I used to be a translator, and I know **Brazilian Portuguese** (vai um aÃ§aÃ­?), **English** (otherwise I wouldn't be writing this), and **German** (ich trinke doch kein Bier);
- This means I'm also a pretty decent writer. Need someone to write your docs?
